<p>Welcome to the world of static blogs! I've been neckdeep in a seemingly stable and wonderful project called <a target="_blank" href="http://getnikola.com">nikola</a>, that allows for some pretty fantastic python static site generation.</p>

<p>I've been using <a target="_blank" href="http://flask.pocoo.org">flask</a> for all my "deploying a quick webapp to openshift" needs, which has worked out splendidly, but after experimenting with <a target="_blank" href="http://thisweekinfedora.org">http://thisweekinfedora.org</a> I felt like I had to dive in head first and see what all the hubub was about.</p>

<p>Some 4-ish hours later, here we are!</p>

<p>Some caveats:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I'm <code>git push -f openshift master</code> to a fresh php5.4 cartridge</li>
    <li>The amazing themes listed at <a target="_blank" href="http://bootswatch.com">bootswatch.com</a> are unvailable to me...
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/decause/8a1e31728f7ac3e81b9c.js"></script>
    </li>
    <li>I don't even know what I don't know I'm doing wrong yet ;)</li>
</ul>

<p>BUT!</p>
<p>I'm <strong>SUPER</strong> excited to play around more with programmatically generating static content with the power of python.</p>
<p>Shout-out <a target="_blank" href="http://lewk.org">lmacken</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://threebean.org">threebean</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://rsb.io">ryansb</a> for their wizardry and patience.</p>
